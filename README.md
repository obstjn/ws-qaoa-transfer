# Transferability Map
### Setup (exemplary for Ubuntu): 
* ``git clone repo-name-here``
* ``cd repo-name-here````
* ``sudo -H pip install virtualenv`` (if you don't have virtualenv installed)
* ``virtualenv venv`` (create virtualenv named 'venv')
* ``source venv/bin/activate`` (enter virtualenv; in Windows systems activate might be in ``venv/Scripts``)
* ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` (install application requirements)

### Usage:
``plots/`` contains all the subgraphs and their corresponding landscapes.
You may also reference this folder for the ordering of the graphs.

The scripts to create plots as well as other calculations are located in ``scripts/``.
